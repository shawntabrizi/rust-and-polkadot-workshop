# Custom Storage

Our Pallet will use 3 storage items to track all of the state.

1. A `StorageValue` named `CountForKitties` which will keep track of the total number of kitties in the Pallet.
	* This `StorageValue` simply keeps track of a `u64` value that we increment when we generate a new kitty. This means we could have up to `18_446_744_073_709_551_615` kitties.... probably more than we will ever need to worry about.
	* It is worth noting the `ValueQuery` configuration in the `StorageValue`. This basically assumes if there is no value in storage, for example at the start of the network, that we should return the value `0` rather than an option `None`.
2. A `StorageMap` named `Kitties` which will map each kitty to it's unique information.
	* To keep kitties completely unique and easy to look up, the key of our map is the `dna` of the kitty. As such, we cannot have two kitties with the same `dna` since the map will have already been populated by one of them.
	*
3. A `StorageMap` named `KittiesOwned` which will map each user to the list of kitties they own.
	* The key for this storage map will be a user account: `T::AccountID`.
	* The value for this storage map will be a `BoundedVec` with the `dna` of the kitties they own. This will make it easy to then look up each individual kitty for its information since the `dna` is used as the key for the `Kitties` map.
	* By using a `BoundedVec`, we ensure that each storage item has a maximum length, which is important for managing limits within the runtime.

#### ** ACTION ITEMS **

Add the following custom storage items to your Pallet.

```rust
/// Keeps track of the number of kitties in existence.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type CountForKitties<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u64, ValueQuery>;

/// Maps the kitty struct to the kitty DNA.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, [u8; 16], Kitty<T>>;

/// Track the kitties owned by each account.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type KittiesOwned<T: Config> = StorageMap<
	_,
	Twox64Concat,
	T::AccountId,
	BoundedVec<[u8; 16], T::MaxKittiesOwned>,
	ValueQuery,
>;
```

#### ** SOLUTION 3 **

This should compile successfully by running:

```bash
cargo build -p pallet-template
```

Don't worry about warnings.

```rust

	pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

	// Allows easy access our Pallet's `Balance` type. Comes from `Fungible` interface.

		BoundedVec<[u8; 16], T::MaxKittiesOwned>,
		ValueQuery,
	>;

	// Your Pallet's configuration trait, representing custom external types and interfaces.
	#[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {

		#[pallet::constant]
		type MaxKittiesOwned: Get<u32>;

		/// The type of Randomness we want to specify for this pallet.
		type KittyRandomness: Randomness<Self::Hash, BlockNumberFor<Self>>;
	}

	// Your Pallet's events.
	#[pallet::event]
	#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
	pub enum Event<T: Config> {}

	// Your Pallet's error messages.
	#[pallet::error]
	pub enum Error<T> {}

	// Your Pallet's callable functions.
	#[pallet::call]
	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {}

	// Your Pallet's internal functions.
	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {}
}
