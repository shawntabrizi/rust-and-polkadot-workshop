## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to **teach by experience** various entry level concepts around Polkadot Pallet development.

The tutorial is designed to be completed by anyone with basic familiarity with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and little to no familiarity with the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk).

If you do not feel comfortable with the level of Rust used in this tutorial, we recommend you first check out the [`rust-state-machine`](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/rust-state-machine) tutorial.
