# Install

For the first day workshop, you will just need to install Rust and use a code editor of your choice.

For the second day workshop, you will need to install additional Rust features to make Substrate and the Polkadot-SDK work.

In general, follow the instructions found on this page to prepare yourself for both workshops:

## Windows Development

As a note, using Substrate on Windows is going to be a bit harder than a unix based operating system like MacOS or Linux.

It is doable, especially when using Windows Subsystem for Linux, but if you have access to a unix environment, you should use that.
