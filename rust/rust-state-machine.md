## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to **teach by experience** various entry level concepts around Rust and blockchain development.

This tutorial is opinionated, and heavily influenced by the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate), and [FRAME](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame). However, everything in this tutorial is written from scratch and built without using these libraries.

The tutorial is designed with the hope that readers who complete it will have a better understanding of what is happening behind FRAME and will feel more capable of using the Polkadot-SDK successfully.

This tutorial will teach and review many Rust concepts, however it is not a replacement for a primary Rust education course. It is recommended, before you even start this tutorial, that you are already familiar with the concepts taught in the first 11 chapters of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
